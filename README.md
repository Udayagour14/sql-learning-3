# SQL-Revision
### **ðŸš€ Day 3 of my 15-day SQL revision journey with MySQL! ðŸŽ‰ Even with my experience in SQL, I'm excited to revisit the basics and showcase my skills to potential recruiters. Today, I set up my environment and use where clause and order by for filter and sorting. I have selected data from tables which was created from sql-learning-day 1. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more SQL practice and insights over the 15 days!** ###
### Filtering Data with WHERE Clause and Sorting with ORDER BY Clause in MySQL
### The WHERE clause is used to filter records that meet certain conditions, and the ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set. Below are examples ranging from basic to advanced use cases of these clauses.

## Filtering Data:

Use the WHERE clause to filter records based on conditions.
Combine multiple conditions using AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, and NOT.
Sorting Data:

## Use the ORDER BY clause to sort the result set.
Specify sorting order with ASC (ascending) and DESC (descending).
Sort by multiple columns by listing them separated by commas.
Combining Filtering and Sorting:

First filter the data using the WHERE clause.
Then sort the filtered data using the ORDER BY clause.
